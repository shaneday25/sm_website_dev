      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p> Hello Mel and Mathew, </p> 
      <p>This is a first go at trying to layout the pages and the navigation.  Initially I am trying to focus on the page layout, but particularly focusing on
      a page layout that is compatible with mobile phones, tablets, laptops and PCs. Try resizing the screen or using it on different devices and see what you think.  For now this page is just for 
      messing about and trying different ideas.  I will delete it once we have something worth looking at.</p>
      <p>The images and text are just palceholders and we can change just about everything. I've tried to keep the menu very simple with the main tabs to view.  Additional additional pages under the 'more......' tab.  
      We could replace this with a burger, i.e. 3 horizontal lines, if you would prefer.  Initally I think we should go for keeping things very clean and simple, ideally with a bit 
      of a modern look.</p>
      </p>As a future refinement we could add music dance instructions, possibly protected by password.  I've given a bit of an example below but, for now, I think that is a distraction, so while I'm tempted I'm not 
      going to look at it now.</P>  
      <p>I've written it all in native code, which should mean it is easy to relocate and maintain.  I'm not sure where it is hosted and what is available, but will worry about that another day.</p>      </p>
      <p>The diary on the calendar tab is just an experiment at the moment.  It is currently linked to a diary on my personal Google account, but could just as easily be added to a diary on the 
      Shakespeare Morris account.  It could provide an easy way to keep things up to date, but probably needs to be seperate from the general calendar so it doesn't get filled up 
      with crap!</p>
      <p>I quite like the picture at the top of the home page, but I only have a very low resolution version of it that doesn't look that great on my laptop - we can fix that.</p>
      <p>We could also do video if it is of an appropriate resolution.  I would have put something in but don't have anything.</p>
      <p>I would propose that the footer contains a link to our facebook pages via an icon - easy to do just haven't got round to it yet.  Do we do Instrgram?</p>
      <p>I've set out the next steps below.  Let me know what you think and tell me what you would like.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Sort out what pages we want - at least the pages we want to start with - let's not be too ambitious - keep it simple.</li>
        <li>Sort out the general page structure / style, the navigation and at least the presentation of the navigation.  We can tweak the styling at a later date.  As a starting point I've gone for a menu that 
          stays at the top of the page.  On the Index page the Shakespeare Morris banner then dissapears.  I was also going to go for a footer on every page with a link to 'the socials' and possibly a contact email - do we have info Shakespeare Morris?  The thinking here is to make it easy to connect to everything else.</li>
        <li>Agree on the initial text formats, fonts and colour scheme - we could tweak this later - examples below.  Again we should go for one or two concepts and stick with them.  We should avoid the temptation to adopt every possible combination and feature available.</li>
        <li>Decide the message we want to give on each page and get the main headings in.  Personally I'd keep the top level information that we want to communicate on the home page as people may not click beyond that.</li>
        <li>Select images and draft the text.  Less is more in my opinion.  We could do something to expand to reveal additional text if with thought it was considered appropriate - you know the thing, you click on 'more' and more appears.  It is easy to do. </li>
        <li>Get a first draft, review it and critique it.</li>
        <li>Refine it and test it on different devices, and browsers and with different signal levels.</li>
        <li>Ship it!</li>
      </ol>  
    </div>

<div class="w3-container">
<h2>Header</h2>
<p>An idea for a header and how to incorporate Shakespeare colours. I can come up with more ideas if you think it is worth bothering with. I was going to suggest we put something like this at the top of the some or all of the pages.</p>
</div>

<div class="w3-panel w3-topbar w3-bottombar w3-border-red w3-yellow">
  <h2 class="w3-center">Shakespeare Morris</h2>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
  <h2>Fonts and text</h2>
  <p>There are lots of options.  I'd be keen to go for something modern.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What we currently have on this page is now Bookman old style</li>
    <li class="w3-cursive">I don't like this because it looks cheap</li>
    <li class="p3">I would prefer something like this.  Perhaps a bit bigger</li>
    <li class="p4">This is times roman</li>
    <li class="p5">This is good old Arial</li>
    <li class="p6">This is Lucida Console</li>
    <li class="w3-large">This is Bookman old style but a bit larger.  It is not recommended to be websafe</li>
    <li class="p7">Georgia sans-serif</li>
    <li class="p7 w3-large">Georgia sans-serif</li>
  </ol>
  <P>Obviously everything would line up if the font was the same.</P>
  <p>We can obviously also change the colour and size of the font.</p>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
  <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>We can of course do images in different layouts.</p>
  <p>We could have a full width image, either right up to the edge or set in a bit.</p>
  <img src="images/nigel.jpg" alt="Nigel"style="width:100%">
  <p>Two images side by side that appear in a column on a mobile.  It would also be perfectly reasonable to put an image in one side and text or a caption in the other.</p>
  <div class="w3-cell-row">
    <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
      <img src="images/jig.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
      <img src="images/tracey.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Three images side by side that appear in a column on a mobile.</p>
  <div class="w3-cell-row">
    <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
      <img src="images/jig.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
      <img src="images/tracey.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
      <img src="images/shane.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Four images side by side that appear in a column on a mobile.</p>
  <div class="w3-cell-row">
    <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
      <img src="images/jig.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
      <img src="images/tracey.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
      <img src="images/shane.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
      <img src="images/nigel.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If required we could add borders or other visual treatments.
    <div class="w3-cell-row">
      <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
        <img src="images/nigel.jpg" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
        <img src="images/nigel.jpg" class="w3-opacity" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
        <img src="images/nigel.jpg" class="w3-grayscale-max" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-container w3-cell w3-mobile">
        <img src="images/nigel.jpg" class="w3-sepia-max" alt="Dancers" style="width:100%"><br>
      </div>
    </div>



  </p>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
<h2>Image carousel</h2>
<p>We can of course do this sort of stuff.  We could easily adjust the timing or the transitions.  I wouldn't recommend more than ten to fifteen images in a carousel.</p>
  <div class="w3-content w3-section" style="max-width:800px">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_1.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_2.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_3.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_4.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_5.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_6.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_7.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_8.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_9.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_10.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <img class="mySlides" src="images/car_17.jpg" style="width:100%">
  </div>

</div>

<div class="w3-container">
  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>We could incorporate music on our hidden pages, something like this.</p><br>
  <audio controls>
    <source src="audio/Clip_1.wav" type="audio/wav">
    Your browser does not support the audio tag.
  </audio>
  <p>And we could have the dots.</p>
  <img src="images/constantbilly_bidford.png" alt="Constant Billy - Bidford"style="width:100%">
  <P>Downloading  PDF file of the music is also a possibility.</P>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
  <h2>Dance instructions</h2>
  <p>Adding dance instructions is very easy - something like the following Standton Harcourt dance below as an example.  Could be in a different font or colour or with a different background.</p>
  <h2>Nutting Girl / A Nutting We Will Go</h2>
  <h3>Formation</h3>
  <p>Set of 6, in 3 pairs - conventional.</p>

  <h3>Style</h3>
  <p>Handkerchief. A Side Step and Half Hey dance.</p>

  <h3>Dance Sequence</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once to Yourself</li>
      <li>Dance Facing</li>
      <li>Distinctive Figure</li>
      <li>Advance Meet And Retire</li>
      <li>Distinctive Figure</li>
      <li>Crossover</li>
      <li>Distinctive Figure</li>
      <li>Back to Back</li>
      <li>Distinctive Figure</li>
      <li>Whole Rounds</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h3>Distinctive Figure</h3>
<p>All Dancers face up and dance 4 bars of Side Step vigorously on the spot and not moving forward, then Half Hey.  Repeat again with all facing up for the Side Step.</p>
<p>Note during the Half Hey the bottom pair does a full turn, despite the way they are facing.

<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>This dance can be used as a processional dance moving forward rapidly on the Side Step.</p>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
  <h2>Footer</h2>
  <p>Below is a first version of a footer.  I think this should include a link to the socials and include a email address, possibly even a telephone number.  I could make the footer sit at the bottom of the screen if that is preferable.</p><br>
</div>
    <footer class="w3-black">
      <br>
      <h2 class="w3-center">Shakespeare Morris</h2>
      <br>
    </footer>
