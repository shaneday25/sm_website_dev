      Mel and Mathew, this is a first go at trying to layout the pages and the navigation.  Initially I am trying to focus on the page layout, but particularly focusing on
      a page layout that is compatible with mobile phones, tablets, laptops and PCs. Try resizing the screen or using it on different devices and see what you think.
      The images and text are just palceholders and we can change just about everything. I've tried to keep the menu very simple with additional pages under the 'more......' tab.  
      We could replace this with a burger, i.e. 3 horizontal lines, if you would prefer.  Initally I think we should go for keeping things very clean and simple, ideally with a bit 
      of a modern look.  I've written it 
      all in native code, which it should keep it easy to relocate.  I'm not sure where it is hosted and what is available, without paying more money. 
      </p>

      The diary is just an experiment at the moment.  It is currently linked to a diary on my personal Google account, but could just as easily be added to a diary on the 
      Shakespeare Morris account.  It could provide an easy way to keep things up to date, but probably needs to be seperate from the general calendar so it doesn't get filled up 
      with crap.  
      </p>

      I quite like the picture at the top of this page, but only have a very low resolution version of it that doesn't look that great on my laptop - we can fix that.
